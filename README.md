MP3::DB
======

scan, index, transform and publish MP3 collections in MongoDB

MP3::DB is a simple tool to scan, index and import ID3 tag information from MP3 collections into a MongoDB, transform 
this data and export it for use with knightlab's TimeLine.

This module relies on the amazing Dist::Zilla for building, testing, etc.

MP3::DB comes with a rather complete documentation, see perldoc for usage.

About the code
--------------

This module has been written as an exercice to explore interacting with MongoDB from Perl and playing with TimeLine.

The object model has been kept really simple and na√Øve for two reasons:
    1. The tool already relies on App::Cmd, adding Moose would just have slowed startup even more for no obvious benefit
    2. MP3::DB has been written while exploring the domain at the same time; keeping the object model simple proved much 
    helpful

Likewise, some shortcuts have been taken in the code, since the main objective was to get a working tool quickly out 
the door and not necessarily to do the right thing in every case.

It is very likely MP3::DB will evolve into a general purpose data preparation tool for TimeLine-like libraries. 
This means I might update the code here whenever I spot something really wrong or broken, but the main effort will now
be directed toward the new, generalised module.
